            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I'm a computer science student at the University of Minnesota with a strong interest in software
                engineering and graphics-related technologies. I've always had a passion for computers and
                problem-solving, and I'm excited by the challenge of turning ideas into working code. Whether it's
                building tools, exploring visual computing, or collaborating on team projects, Iâ€™m always looking for
                ways to grow as a developer and deepen my understanding of the field.</p>
